Effects of monetary policy on labour income: the role of the employer,"This article investigates how firms transmit monetary policy shocks to individual labour market outcomes at both the intensive and extensive margins. Using matched employer-employee administrative data from Germany, we study the effects of monetary policy shocks on individual employment and of labour income conditioning on characteristics of workers and firms. First, we find that the employment of workers at young firms is especially sensitive to monetary policy shocks. Second, wages of workers at large firms react more than those at small firms, with some pronounced asymmetries – differences between large and small firms are more evident during monetary policy easing. The differential wage response is driven by workers earning above-median wages and cannot be fully explained by a worker component. Notably, larger firms adjust wages more significantly despite experiencing similar changes in investment and turnover compared to smaller firms.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/research-publications/resbull/2025/html/ecb.rb250326~d412e364ce.en.html,2025-03-26T08:00:00+01:00,ECB – Research Bulletin,['Germany'],216.0,Older,"['labour market', 'labour', 'employment']",6.00447951485026,1.9465498750798729,"firms, monetary, wages, workers, shocks",16,3,0.25,"Political, Economic, Technological",,False

Fiscal drag in theory and in practice: a European perspective,"This paper presents a comprehensive characterization of “fiscal drag”—the increase in tax revenue that occurs when nominal tax bases grow but nominal parameters of progressive tax legislation are not updated accordingly—across 21 European countries using a microsimulationapproach. First, we estimate tax-to-base elasticities, showing that the progressivity built in each country’s personal income tax system induces elasticities around 1.7–2 for many countries, indicating a potential for large fiscal drag effects. We unpack these elasticities to show stark heterogeneity in their underlying mechanisms (tax brackets or tax deductions and credits), across income sources (labor, capital, self-employment, public benefits), and across the individual income distribution. Second, we extend the analysis beyond these elasticities to study fiscal drag in practice between 2019 and 2023, incorporating observed income growth and legislative changes. We quantify the actual impact of fiscal drag and the extent to which government policies have offset it, either through indexation or other reforms. Our results provide new insights into the fiscal and distributional effects of fiscal drag in Europe, as well as useful statistics for modeling public finances.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3136~7e214e2ce2.en.pdf,2025-10-09T11:00:00+02:00,ECB – Publications,['microsimulationapproach'],19.0,Last 30 days,"['employment', 'reform', 'benefits']",3.061638901124028,1.4015865623883275,"drag, fiscal, tax, elasticities, income",60,3,0.25,"Political, Economic",,False

Battle of the ages: distributional and aggregate effects of monetary policy in a model with age demographics,"We develop a model in which agents face unemployment risk, but also age and eventually retire. We study the impact of different retirement schemes on life-cycle consumption and the monetary transmission mechanism. Agents save because of a fall in income upon retirement, changes along the life-cycle wage profile, and unemployment risk. Changes in retirement policies affect the distribution of available assets (bonds) among the middle aged and the young, which in turn can have a strong impact on the ability of the young to insure themselves against unemployment risk. Interestingly, it is possible that an increase in retirement benefits leads to higher consumption levels during sustained unemployment spells even though the associated increase in taxes reduces unemployment benefits. The reason is that this policy induces the middle aged to save less which leaves more of the available asset supply to the young. A reduction in the interest rate has a bigger impact on those for whom labor market conditions improve the most and – due to a larger negative income effect – has a smaller impact on those who save more. In terms of the aggregate impact of monetary-policy shocks, our paper confirms conventional wisdom that the expansion is magnified in the presence of incomplete markets, since it is then accompanied by a fall in precautionary savings. The novel aspect of our analysis is that the extent of the incompleteness, i.e., the ability of those subject to unemployment risk to insure themselves, is endogenous. Specifically, it is reduced as the young (middle-aged) hold a larger (smaller) fraction of the available asset supply and this distribution is not only affected by retirement policies, but also by government bond supply and the life-cycle wage profile. Thus, understanding the distribution of assets across different age cohorts is not only important for understanding life-cycle consumption patterns, but also business cycles.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3125~bc2833900c.en.pdf,2025-09-30T11:00:00+02:00,ECB – Working Papers,[],28.0,Last 30 days,"['employment', 'benefits']",2.7864814417371964,1.3314372083943251,"unemployment, retirement, cycle, life, risk",80,2,0.3333333333333333,"Political, Economic, Technological",,False

Heterogeneous effects of monetary tightening in response to energy price shocks,"This article analyses how monetary policy shapes the aggregate and distributional effects of an energy price shock. Based on the observed heterogeneity in consumption exposures to energy and household wealth, we build a quantitative small open-economy Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model that matches salient features of the euro area data. The model incorporates energy as both a consumption good for households with non-homothetic preferences as well as a factor input into production with input complementarities. Independently of policy, energy price shocks always reduce aggregate consumption. Households with little wealth are more adversely affected through both a decline in labour income as well as negative direct price effects. Active policy responses raising rates in response to inflation amplify aggregate outcomes through a reduction in aggregate demand, but speed up the recovery by enabling households to rebuild wealth through higher returns on savings. However, low-wealth households are also adversely affected by having less savings from which to rebuild wealth and instead lose out due to further declining labour income.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/research-publications/resbull/2024/html/ecb.rb241023~57265f3bf5.en.html,2024-10-23T08:00:00+02:00,ECB – Research Bulletin,['New Keynesian'],370.0,Older,['labour'],2.00000880504106,1.098615223677489,"wealth, energy, aggregate, households, price",102,1,0.5,"Political, Economic, Technological, Environmental",,False

From Brussels to Bangkok: how investment funds transmit financial spillovers,"We explore whether investment funds transmit spillovers from local shocks to financial markets in other economies. As a laboratory we consider shocks to financialmarket beliefs about the probability of a rare, euro-related disaster and their spillovers to Asian sovereign debt markets. Given their geographic distance from and relatively limited macroeconomic exposure to the euro area, these markets are an ideal testing ground a priori stacking the deck against finding evidence for investment funds transmitting spillovers from euro disaster risk shocks. Analyzing proprietary security-level holdings data over the period from 2014 to 2023, we find that investment funds strongly shed Asian sovereign debt in response to euro disaster risk shocks. Markets with greater investment-fund presence exhibit considerably larger price spillovers. The main driver of this sell-off is the need to generate liquidity to meet investor redemption demands rather than portfolio rebalancing. Especially market liquidity determines which sovereign debt investment funds shed. Taken together, our findings suggest that due to a flighty investor base investment funds are powerful transmitters of spillovers from local shocks across global financial markets.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3131~75df71d025.en.pdf,2025-10-06T11:00:00+02:00,ECB – Publications,"['Brussels', 'Bangkok']",22.0,Last 30 days,['security'],1.4803053010897993,0.9083816578782028,"funds, spillovers, investment, shocks, markets",196,1,0.5,"Economic, Technological",,False
How do rising temperatures affect inflation expectations?,"Global temperatures are rising at an alarming pace and public awareness of climate change is increasing, yet little is known about how these developments affect consumer expectations. We address this gap by conducting a series of experiments within a large-scale, population-representative survey of euro area consumers. We randomly assign consumers to hypothetical global temperature change scenarios, after which we elicit their expectations for inflation and key macroeconomic indicators under these conditions. We find that a 0.5°C rise in global temperatures leads to a 0.65 percentage point increase in five-year-ahead inflation expectations, with effects particularly pronounced among consumers with greater awareness of climate change. Additionally, respondents expect adverse impacts of global warming on economic growth, employment, public debt, tax burdens, and their well-being. Despite these pessimistic expectations, many consumers demonstrate limited willingness to pay for mitigating further temperature increases. Instead, they place primary responsibility for climate action on governments. Our findings underscore the interplay between climate change and economic expectations, highlighting the potential implications for monetary and fiscal policy in a warming world.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3132~416696f737.en.pdf,2025-10-06T11:00:00+02:00,ECB – Publications,[],22.0,Last 30 days,['employment'],1.4803053010897993,0.9083816578782028,"expectations, consumers, change, global, temperatures",197,1,0.5,"Political, Economic, Environmental",,False
Hidden weaknesses: the role of unrealized losses in monetary policy transmission,"This paper investigates how unrealized losses on banks’ amortized cost securities affect monetary policy transmission to bank lending in the euro area. Leveraging the sharp increase in interest rates between 2022 and 2023 and using granular supervisory data on security holdings and loan-level credit register data, we show that a one percentage point increase in the share of unrealized losses on amortized cost securities amplifies the contractionary effect of monetary tightening on lending supply by approximately one percentage point. This effect is more pronounced for weakly capitalized and less liquid banks, and those relying more on uninsured deposits. We further document that banks respond to growing unrealized losses by raising capital and passing through interest rate increases to depositors via higher deposit betas. Importantly, banks that employ interest rate hedging strategies can fully offset the negative impact of unrealized losses on credit supply. The contraction in lending is particularly severe for smaller borrowing firms, highlighting the uneven economic consequences of hidden balance sheet fragilities during a tightening cycle.",https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3129~9d788ef5bc.en.pdf,2025-10-02T11:00:00+02:00,ECB – Working Papers,[],26.0,Last 30 days,['security'],1.4203503845086818,0.8839123166750295,"unrealized, losses, banks, lending, monetary",198,1,0.5,"Political, Technological",,False
